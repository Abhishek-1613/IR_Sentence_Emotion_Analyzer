# IR_Sentence_Emotion_Analyzer
# Sentence Emotion Analyzer

## Overview
This project aims to detect emotions from sentences using advanced machine learning models. Both LSTM and BERT models are implemented, with BERT showing superior performance in emotion detection.

## Features
- Implementation of LSTM and BERT models for emotion detection.
- Integration of ML, NLP, Reinforcement Learning, and IR concepts.
- Utilization of TensorFlow and PyTorch libraries.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Abhishek-1613/IR_Sentence_Emotion_Analyzer.git
    cd Sentence-Emotion-Analyzer-Webapp-main
    ```

Steps to run the project

Run the app.py file, which starts the project.

project will load the web browser. Click on the 'Try IT' part on the navigation base to test the project using user input.

the project expects one user to tweet as input and click on the Analyze button after that.

model gives a prediction of emotion on a new page where we can see the original tweet with its predicted emotion.


## Results
The project provides a comparison between LSTM and BERT models for emotion detection, highlighting BERT's superior performance.

user can try again with differnt input for detecting emotion.
